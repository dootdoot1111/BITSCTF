# BITSCTF
This is my writeup for the BITSKrieg Induction CTF conducted 11-12 Jan 2021


Pretty sure the ctf will be down by now, but here : [CTF](https://ctf.bitskrieg.org/challenges) have the link.

In case the CTF is still up and you're too lazy to read the writeup and want to enter all the flags, here's a pastebin link with all the [flags](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0). Thank me later.
