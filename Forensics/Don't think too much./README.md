#  Don't think too much. 

We'll do what the challenge title says and just not think too much. This time the challenge provides us with three files. A password protected zip file, a text file with a 'master' password and an image of a random dude.

Well the image is not that of a random dude but is that of the great Julius Caesar. To solve with challenge you require a tool most commonly used for [steganography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography) problems in CTF's called steghide.

[Steghide](https://github.com/StefanoDeVuono/steghide) is used to hide data in LSB of jpeg images. It can also be password protected, which it is, for our challenge.
