# Listen Close (Not really.)

This challenge requires us to analyze audio files in a altogether different way. It gives us an audio file and a password proteced zip file. For this challenge we'll be using an audio analysis software called [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/download/).

Open audacity and import the wav file in it.

Next, we view the 'Spectrogram' of the audio file. It is a visual representation of the audio file under some frequencies vs time. To do this click on the small arrow beside the file name in audacity and select Spectrogram.

After the screen turns somewhat colourful, stretch the waveform, a bit until the text, becomes clear and readable.(Which is a bit tough, you'll nead to focus, it hurts your eye tho).

If you struggle with getting a clear image, try using other spectrogram tools, like [Sonic Visualiser](https://sonicvisualiser.org/download.html), or online tools.
