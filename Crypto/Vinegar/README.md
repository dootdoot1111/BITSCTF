# Vinegar

The name vinegar of the challenge hints toward a cipher commmonly used and named 'Vigenere'. 

We'll use [Boxentriq](https://www.boxentriq.com/code-breaking/vigenere-cipher) to solve our question, but you can very well write you own code for it.(I'm too lazy for that.)

Now, since we know our flag starts with ```BITSCTF``` we can try guessing the key letter-by-letter, which gives us 's' as the first letter of the key, and then just pressing the consecutive keys on the keyboard, we see the key happens to be 'sdfg'.

Enter the key to get the flag!
