# Cleoxenus and Democleitus 

This challenge requires you to google stuff. Or duckduckgo, if you're not okay with selling your data to corporates.

Anyways, here's the challenge text :

#### There should be a list on wikipedia of all the variations it has. The key should be simple.

#### b2FyYmFlY2x3cmRxc2I=

A text ending with the '=' is often encoded with base64. Base64 decode the string to get plaintext. 

Now if you google the challenge name, i.e 'Cleoxenus and Democleitus', we see that these guys had something to do with the [Polybius Square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polybius_square) cipher.

Now the challenge text asks us to find the variants for it on wikipedia, which can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Cryptography_classical).

You can try all the variants one by one one, by googling their online decoders, but incase, you're really stuck, there, its a 'Bifid' cipher.

Use the key 'simple' to [decode](http://rumkin.com/tools/cipher/bifid.php) the cipher and get the flag! (Remember to add the flag format BITSCTF{..} )
