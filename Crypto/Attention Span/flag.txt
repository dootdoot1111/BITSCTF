FREQUENCY ANALYSIS BASED CRYPTANALYSIS USES THE FACT THAT NATURAL LANGUAGE IS NOT RANDOM IN NATURE AND SINGLE ALPHABETIC BASED SUBSTITUTION DOES NOT HIDE THE STATISTICAL PROPERTIES OF THE NATURAL LANGUAGE.

THE MOST FREQUENT LETTER MAY REPRESENT THE MOST COMMON LETTER IN ENGLISH, E FOLLOWED BY T, A, O AND I WHEREAS THE LEAST FREQUENT ARE Q, K AND X.
