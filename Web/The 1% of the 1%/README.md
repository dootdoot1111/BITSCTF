# The 1% of the 1%

Challenge link : [The 1% of the 1%](https://ctf.bitskrieg.org/web_chall3/index.html)

For solving this challenge, we head over to the challenge link. Left click on the page and select 'Inspect Element'. Get in a habit of doing this.
Notice the script tag :

Navigate to the javascript by adding the name of the js file after /web_chall3/ in you browser. Notice the function :

Navigate to the html file, to fing you flag!

PS: This is not the intended way to solve this challenge, rather the challenge asks you to change you user-agent string to "Samsung Smart Fridge" and click on the recieve coupon to get the flag.User-agent can be switched quickly by installing some addons to your Browser(Chrome/Firefox). But Samsung Smart fridges are too expensive for me.
